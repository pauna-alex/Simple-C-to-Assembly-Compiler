Here is a short description of the compiler based on the assignment details:

This project involves developing a minimalistic compiler (technically a transpiler) that translates simple C-like code snippets into basic assembly instructions. The goal is to bridge the gap between high-level programming and low-level machine operations by mapping constructs like arithmetic, data movement, and control flow to assembly mnemonics. It serves as a simplified introduction to compiler design and the internal workings of code execution.
